# Leaflet-Map
Interactive map I made in my 2022 internship using the Leaflet library

Web mapping is continually changing, with new difficulties in terms of usability, service advantages, quality, and innovation. 
GIS play an important part in the Web mapping service, assuring the user's investigative abilities in Web mapping. 
This is why professionals frequently use the terms GIS and Web mapping interchangeably. By assisting with data collecting, data storage, and software architecture, 
GIS makes the Web mapping service more user-friendly. I decided to improve my skills every day by learning and applying new knowledge during the internship. 

For the Project 
I created a map showing Gebze, Kocaeli. There are 4 steps creating a basic leaflet map; Create HTML page, Reference the files of the open-source Leaflet JavaScript library(I need to include the Leaflet library's essential JavaScript and CSS files because I'm utilizing it), Prepare the data(I need coordinate values like latitude and longitude to plot any map), Set up the Leaflet map(It is most exiting part of project for me because creating the map by writing some lines of code. I was amazed when few lines of code are required to create fully functional maps with Leaflet. Also this part I think that the coding is like play instrument. Code lines are music notes you can use code commands in different places such as notes and do different works)
