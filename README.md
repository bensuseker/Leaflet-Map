# Leaflet-Map
Interactive map I made in my 2022 internship using the Leaflet library

Web mapping is continually changing, with new difficulties in terms of usability, service advantages, quality, and innovation. 
GIS play an important part in the Web mapping service, assuring the user's investigative abilities in Web mapping. 
This is why professionals frequently use the terms GIS and Web mapping interchangeably. By assisting with data collecting, data storage, and software architecture, 
GIS makes the Web mapping service more user-friendly. I decided to improve my skills every day by learning and applying new knowledge during the internship.
